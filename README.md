# Credit-Card-application-Classifier



## 📌 Project Overview
This project develops predictive models to determine whether a credit card applicant is likely to default.  
The analysis uses historical data provided in **HW4-Train.csv** and **HW4-Validation.csv**, containing 20 predictor variables and a binary default indicator.

The goal is to:
1. Perform data preprocessing  
2. Build and evaluate a **Logistic Regression** model  
3. Build and evaluate a **Random Forest** (ML) model  
4. Compare model performance and justify the final model choice  
5. Evaluate fairness (existing-account customers)  
6. Provide recommendations for future credit approval decisions
